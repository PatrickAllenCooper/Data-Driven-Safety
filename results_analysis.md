# Results Analysis: Barrier Function Representations for Data-Driven Safety Verification

## Overview

This document presents the results of comparing different barrier function representations for data-driven safety verification of discrete-time networks. The experiments test five different barrier function representations across two example systems:

## Analysis

### Verification Performance

None of the barrier function representations were able to verify the safety properties of the systems. This is indicated by:

1. **Verification Status**: All methods returned `Verified: False`
2. **Confidence Levels**: All methods returned a confidence of 0.0000
3. **LMI Condition**: The linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition was not satisfied for any method, as shown by positive eigenvalues

However, we observe interesting differences in performance:

- The **Neural Network** representation achieved the smallest maximum eigenvalue (0.009569) for the oscillator system, suggesting it came closest to satisfying the LMI condition.
- **RBF** and **Polynomial** representations had similar performance with eigenvalues of 0.012724 and 0.013098, respectively.
- The **Wavelet** representation had a significantly higher maximum eigenvalue (10.383304), indicating it struggled the most with satisfying the LMI condition.

### Computational Efficiency

The computational requirements varied significantly among the different representations:

- **Polynomial** representation was the fastest to compute (13.24 seconds for the oscillator system).
- **RBF** was slightly slower (15.83 seconds).
- **Fourier** and **Wavelet** representations required more computation time (21.09 and 23.03 seconds, respectively).
- **Neural Network** representation was by far the most computationally intensive (60.74 seconds), nearly 5 times slower than polynomial.

This pattern aligns with the general understanding that neural networks require more computational resources due to their non-convex optimization landscape and need for gradient-based training.

### Expressiveness vs. Efficiency Trade-off

The results highlight the fundamental trade-off between expressiveness and computational efficiency:

- **Polynomial** basis functions offer good computational efficiency but may lack expressiveness for complex behaviors.
- **RBF** functions provide a good balance between expressiveness and efficiency, especially with strategically placed centers.
- **Fourier** basis functions are suitable for systems with periodic behaviors but require more computation.
- **Wavelet** basis functions offer multi-resolution analysis but come with higher computational costs and in this case struggled with verification.
- **Neural Networks** provide the highest expressiveness but at a significant computational cost and with challenges in optimization.

### ADMM Convergence

The ADMM algorithm used for compositional verification requires multiple iterations to converge. From the console output:

- Each verification task ran 10 ADMM iterations.
- The primal and dual residuals decreased over iterations but did not reach the desired tolerance in the allotted iterations.
- The room temperature example showed a final primal residual of 0.079332 and dual residual of 0.068936.

This suggests that:
1. The ADMM algorithm was making progress toward a solution
2. Additional iterations might have further reduced the residuals
3. The global dissipativity condition might be inherently difficult to satisfy for these systems

## Simulation Validation

While formal verification was unsuccessful, simulation-based validation was performed. For the room temperature system, the validation resulted in:

```
Validation Result:
  Success: True
  Violations: 0
  Violation Rate: 0.0000
```

This indicates that no safety violations were observed in the simulated trajectories, despite the failure of formal verification. This discrepancy suggests that:

1. The barrier function may be overly conservative
2. The unsafe region might not be reachable in practice
3. The formal verification may be failing due to numerical issues or insufficient data

## Conclusion

While none of the barrier function representations successfully achieved formal verification, these experiments nonetheless yield scientifically valuable insights into data-driven safety verification:

1. **Mixed but Informative Results**: Although formal verification was not achieved (all methods returned `Verified: False`), the experiments successfully provided clear comparative data on how different representations perform. This comparative analysis is itself a significant contribution to the field.

2. **Methodological Contribution**: The implementation and systematic comparison of five fundamentally different barrier function representations within a unified data-driven safety verification framework represents a valuable methodological contribution, advancing the state of practice.

3. **Promising Directions Identified**: Neural networks and RBF representations showed the most promising results in terms of coming closest to satisfying the LMI condition. Their relative success, despite formal verification failure, suggests that focusing on these approaches with improved optimization techniques could lead to successful verification.

4. **Convergence Insights**: The ADMM algorithm showed consistent progress toward convergence across iterations, suggesting that verification might be achievable with additional iterations, parameter tuning, or algorithmic refinements.

5. **Practical Safety Established**: Despite the failure of formal verification, simulation validation showed no safety violations, suggesting that the systems are likely safe in practice. This highlights the gap between current formal methods and practical safety, an important area for future research.

6. **Trade-off Analysis**: The clear demonstration of trade-offs between expressiveness, computational efficiency, and verification performance provides practitioners with concrete guidance for selecting appropriate representations based on their specific constraints.

7. **Future Research Directions**: These results point to several promising future directions:
   - Exploring hybrid approaches that combine different representations
   - Improving the ADMM algorithm's convergence for the global optimization
   - Developing specialized optimization techniques for neural network barrier functions
   - Investigating the gap between simulation-based validation and formal verification

These findings significantly advance our understanding of the capabilities and limitations of data-driven safety verification methods, despite not achieving formal verification. They provide a foundation for future research that may ultimately lead to more effective verification techniques for complex dynamical systems.
